**BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)**

It is a specification that prescribes a set of low-level routines for performing common linear algebra operations.

There are a lot of implements of BLAS:
* Accelerate : Apple's framework for Mac OS X and iOS, which includes tuned versions of BLAS
* ACML : The AMD Core Math Library, supporting the AMD Athlon and Opteron CPUs under Linux and Windows.
* ATLAS : Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, an open source implementation of BLAS APIs for C and Fortran.
* BLIS : BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software framework for rapid instantiation.
* cuBLAS : Optimized BLAS for NVIDIA based GPU cards.
* clBLAS : An OpenCL implemenation of BLAS.
* Intel MKL : The Intel Math Kernel Library, supporting x86 32-bits and 64-bits. Includes optimizations for Intel Pentium, Core and Intel   Xeon CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi; support for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
